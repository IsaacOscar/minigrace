build:
    Provides instructions for compiling Minigrace.
contributing:
    Provides guidelines for submitting modifications to Minigrace.
errata:
    Describes the differences between Minigrace's implementation and the
    specified Grace language, including both specified features that are
    not implemented, or that are partly implemented, and extensions
    supported by Minigrace that are not standardised. Also enumerates
    various environment variables and options that may be used to

    Provides hints for how to write glue code for interoperability
    between Grace code and other systems for use with Minigrace.
make-targets:
    Describes the targets in the Makefile
modules:
    Describes the locations imported modules are found, and documents
    the modules included in the Minigrace distribution that might be
    useful in user code.
nativeCode
    Describes how to incorporate nateiv JavaScript code into minigrace modules.
    The directory nativeCodeExamples contains some examples.
typeParameters
    Contains notes on the behaviour of type parameters.
unicode:
    Defines the behaviour of Minigrace with regard to Unicode, including
    how strings behave and are defined, which characters are valid in
    identifiers and numbers, and source file encoding.
usage:
    Describes options and modes to the compiler and how the compiler is
    expected to behave.
