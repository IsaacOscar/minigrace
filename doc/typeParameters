A method may be declared with type parameters:
    method foo‚ü¶X,Y‚üß(...) { ... }
The type parameters `X` and `Y` are available as local variables inside the method
body, like other parameters. Only one list of type parameters is
permitted on a method, and they must follow the first part of the method
name.

A method request may have type parameters on it:
    foo‚ü¶Number, String‚üß(...)
These type arguments are optional, but if present must follow the first part
of the method name.

A class declaration may have type parameters:
    class foo‚ü¶X,Y‚üß(...) { ... }
These type parameters are available in the lexical scope of the class
body, like other parameters.

If a method with type parameters is requested without type
arguments, the parameters are bound to `Unknown`. If any
type arguments are provided the full list must be given; providing
too few type arguments is an error.

Type parameters may be used to parameterise other methods or classes
or for pattern-matching. Type parameters are not currently used for
static type checks, and are treated as though they are `Unknown`. Static
checking is to be added in future. At run-time, gradual checks on
parameters of parameterized types will be performed.

In the implementation, type arguments are passed as though they are
aditional ordinary arguments at the end of the argument list.
The receiver can distinguish whether it was called with
type arguments or not by examining the number of provided arguments,
which for this reason is included in the method request.

Grace code does not need to care about the implementation.
